# NZ Covid Pass Linker Bot (VaxxyBot)

This is a system made to store and verify a user's self submitted COVID vaccination status.

It is currently running as a Telegram bot in the trial phase, suitable for hosting private events or
keeping a small register.

More information on this bot service can be found under
[https://vaxxy.pixelcollider.net](https://vaxxy.pixelcollider.net) or
[@VaxxyBot](https://t.me/VaxxyBot) on Telegram.

The key goal is to smooth the process of COVID pass verification by obfuscating the identifying
information where it is not needed, and encouraging single checks for a pass' lifetime in cases
where additional ID checks are required.

It uses a privacy focused approach that relies on the digital signature from the pass and human
notaries for a full level of confirmation. This approach acknowledges the potential flaws in a
digital system in identifying stolen or forged passes, and supplimenting it with manual checks,
allowing for a greater sense of community trust in the technology.

Manual entries and a system for exceptions are currently being worked on.

This service and website is running under the ownership of

An aside: Ultimately, the problem of COVID is a social one once it is under control, and we must
choose how we protect ourselves, and how we trust others to protect us through vaccinations and
other public health measures.
